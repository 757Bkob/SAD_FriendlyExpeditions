I managed to pick one that seemed to have eaten recently.

Thanks to that, I was able to immediately direct it to some food I had placed on the ground.
It took a few tries for it to recognize the non-moving thing as food..... it finally seemed to understand.

A Gujo who has been successful in its hunt randomly saw my new friend, and in it's.... infinite wisdom, decided to follow along.
